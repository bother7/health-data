The ACA provides for a program of risk adjustment in the individual and small group markets using the HHS risk adjustment methodology, so as to compensate health insurance plans for differences in enrollee health mix so plan premiums reflect differences in scope of coverage and other plan factors, but not differences in health status. The methodology includes a risk adjustment model and a risk transfer formula. The article, Affordable Care Act Risk Adjustment - Overview, Context, and Challenges, describes the key program goal and issues in the HHS developed risk adjustment methodology and identifies key choices in how it responds to these issues, while The HHS-HCC Risk Adjustment Model for Individual and Small Group Markets under the Affordable Care Act, estimates differences in health risks taking into account the new population and scope of coverage. Risk Transfer Formula for Individual and Small Group Markets under the Affordable Care Act, describes how the transfer formula calculates balanced transfers intended to account for health risk differences while preserving permissible premium differences.","HasHealthData":0,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"cynthia.porter@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"Cynthia Porter","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"","DatasetGroupName":"","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"mmrr-editors@cms.hhs.gov","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"Medicare","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"529","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publications"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicaid-Expansion"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicare Advantage"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Health Insurance Marketplace"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Physician Services"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Hospital"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Inpatient"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Outpatient"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Part D"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"National"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Quality"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Claims"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Covered Services"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Eligibility"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Enrollment"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Expenditures"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Payments"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1410251629000+0000)\/","Name":"ACA Risk Adjustment - Overview, Context, and Challenges","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr\/Articles\/A2013\/MMRR2013_003_04_a01.html","Description":"Accounting for Unobservable Exposure Time Bias When Using Medicare Prescription Drug Data\u000d\u000aUnobservable exposure time is common among Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and they are often in worse health.

It also gives specific information by state. The results should be encouraging for researchers and policymakers.

Patients with a ratio of less than 0.5 (meaning fewer controller and more rescue medication claims) were 1.5-2.0 times more likely to have a subsequent emergent healthcare visit than children with higher ratios. Providers and payers may consider tracking the asthma medication ratio and using it to signal pediatric patients at high risk for emergent health care visits. This will allow targeted interventions to improve controller medication use in these highest risk patients.

The percent of children with any expense for prescription drugs decreased by 5.8 percent. Among those with prescription fills, expenses decreased by 7.9 percent. The largest decline was for antihistamine drugs, the smallest for central nervous system agents, which include antidepressants.

CHIPRA required HHS to identify and publish a core measure set of childrens health care quality measures for voluntary use by State Medicaid and CHIP programs. On December 29, 2009, the Secretary posted for public comment in the Federal Register, an initial core set of 24 childrens health care quality measures for voluntary use by Medicaid and CHIP programs. The core set includes a range of childrens quality measures encompassing both physical and mental health. The 2015 Child Core Set was released through a December 2014 Informational Bulletin. The CHIPRA legislation provides that the Secretary shall issue updates to the Child Core Set beginning in January 2013 and annually thereafter. CMS worked with the National Quality Forums (NQF) Measures Application Partnership (MAP) to review the Child Core Set and to identify ways to improve it. A background report contains information on the MAPs review process, selection criteria, and feedback to CMS. State data derived from the core measures are part of the Secretarys Annual Report on the Quality of Care for Children in Medicaid and CHIP. States can voluntarily report the Child Core Set measures by using the 2015 Technical Specifications and Resource Manual. A summary of updates to the child core set technical specifications and resource manual for FFY 2015 is also available.

The statute requires that Medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for selected Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) items with a competitive bid process. The intent is to improve the effectiveness of the Medicare methodology for setting DMEPOS payment amounts, which will reduce beneficiary out-of-pocket expenses and save the Medicare program money while ensuring beneficiary access to quality items and services. The Competitive Acquisition Omburdsmans (CAOs) role is to help ensure that inquiries and complaints about the Program are resolved. As an ombudsman, the CAO also works with other areas of CMS to identify potential systemic issues with the goal of helping CMS ensure that beneficiaries have access to and suppliers provide high-quality DMEPOS items and services. The CAO also provides an annual report to Congress. In order to protect the interests of potentially affected Medicare beneficiaries, CMS has been conducting real-time claims analysis to monitor health status for groups of Medicare beneficiaries in competitive bidding areas (CBAs). Health status results are shown in the files on this site. Each file includes a written summary of results and graphical displays of key indicators reflective of the health status of beneficiaries and their access to DMEPOS items and services. The data is derived from claims for Medicare populations in each CBA and a corresponding comparator region that is similar to the CBA.","HasHealthData":1,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"james.krometis@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"James Krometis","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"2011-2014","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"","DatasetGroupName":"","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"cms.data@cms.hhs.gov","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"Medicare","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"579","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Fact Sheets"},{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Reports"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicare"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Durable Medical Equipment (DME)"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Suppliers"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"Regional"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Quality"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Access to Care"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Claims"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1450788834000+0000)\/","Name":"DMEPOS Competitive Bidding","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"https:\/\/www.cms.gov\/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems\/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports\/Insight-Briefs\/","Description":"About 25 percent of the hospitalizations for dual eligible beneficiaries in 2005 were potentially avoidable.

In early 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released safety warnings about ESA use in non-MDS cancer patients. In August 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services restricted the coverage of ESAs for Medicare non-MDS cancer patients. Researchers report in Effect of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent Policy Decisions on Off-Label Use in Myelodysplastic Syndromes, published in Volume 4, Issue 4 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, that the FDA and CMS policies unintentionally lowered ESA use in Medicare MDS patients by 7.9 percent by the first half of 2008. The policies did not conclusively improve the appropriateness of ESA use, as concordance with two out of the three treatment guidelines that were examined worsened by the first half of 2008.","HasHealthData":0,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr\/","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"fhend001@umaryland.edu","ContactName":"Franklin Hendrick","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"2005-2008","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"","DatasetGroupName":"MMRR","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"mmrr-editors@cms.hhs.gov","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"Medicare","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"554","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publications"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicare"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Pharmacy"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"National"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Quality"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Expenditures"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Utilization"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1417181291000+0000)\/","Name":"Effect of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent Policy Decisions","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr\/Articles\/A2013\/MMRR2013_003_03_a05.html","Description":"Individuals eligible and enrolled simultaneously for Medicare and Medicaid commonly referred to as dual eligible or duals have often been cited as accounting for a disproportionate share of Medicare and Medicaid spending compared with non-dual eligible beneficiaries.

This study elaborates on differences in estimates and how MCBS sampling and data processing dictate the need for special weights. Alternative weighting schemes were compared using estimates from different approaches and with CMS administrative data counts where applicable. Since the differences observed were generally modest, it was concluded on the basis of other factors (such as ease of use, operational simplicity, and methodological soundness) that weights using Ratio Raking adjustments provide a reasonable alternative to traditional ATC survey weights.","HasHealthData":0,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr\/","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"cynthia.porter@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"Cynthia Porter","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"","DatasetGroupName":"MMRR","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"mmrr-editors@cms.hhs.gov","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"Medicare","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"516","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publications"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicare"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Part A"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Part B"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"National"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Research"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Access to Care"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Enrollment"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Survey"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Utilization"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1403861865000+0000)\/","Name":"Ever Enrolled Medicare Population Estimates from the MCBS..","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr\/Briefs\/B2013\/MMRR2014_003_04_b03.html","Description":"A new study, Examination of the Accuracy of Coding Hospital-Acquired Pressure Ulcer Stages, published in Volume 4, Issue 1 of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, examines the observed underreporting of pressure ulcer Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) stages. The authors analyses of Medicare claims data from 2009 and 2010 show that 54 percent of claims with a secondary diagnosis code of a pressure ulcer site did not have any pressure ulcer stage code (compared to only 10 percent of claims with a pressure ulcer as a primary diagnosis). On average, underreporting of stage codes occurred more often in hospitals classified as academic medical centers, larger, urban, or not-for-profit. The combination of capturing 25 diagnosis codes under the new 5010 claim format and the change from ICD-9 to ICD-10 will likely reduce some of the underreporting of the stages for hospital-acquired pressure ulcers.\u000d\u000a","HasHealthData":0,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr\/","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"Cynthia.riegler@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"Cindy Riegler","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"http:\/\/www.resdac.org\/cms-data\/request\/cms-data-request-center","DatasetGroupName":"MMRR","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"mmrr-editors@cms.hhs.gov","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"494","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publications"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicare"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Hospital"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"National"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Admissions"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Claims"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Coding and Coding Rules"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1388649185000+0000)\/","Name":"Examination of the Accuracy of Coding Hospital-Acquired...","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr\/Articles\/A2013\/MMRR2013_003_03_a02.html","Description":"Expansionof Medicaid Covered Smoking Cessation \u000d\u000aServices - Maternal Smoking and Birth Outcomes. \u000d\u000aTo assess whether Medicaid coverage of smoking cessation services reduces maternal smoking and improves birth outcomes.","HasHealthData":0,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"Cynthia.riegler@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"Cindy Riegler","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"http:\/\/www.resdac.org\/cms-data\/request\/cms-data-request-center","DatasetGroupName":"","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"MMRR-Editors@cms.hhs.gov","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"Medicare","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"455","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publications"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicaid"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Substance Abuse Treatment"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"National"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Outcomes"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1375798838000+0000)\/","Name":"Expansion of Medicaid Covered Smoking Cessation Services","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/Medicare\/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment\/FeeScheduleGenInfo\/","Description":"A fee schedule is a complete listing of fees used by Medicare to pay doctors or other providers-suppliers.

Many private insurers implemented similar non-payment policies. Financial impact of the policy to hospitals and insurers was viewed as minimal because of the low rate of HACs, but patient advocates noted that calculations do not account for downstream costs of HACs to CMS and taxpayers.

HCAHPS survey items complement the data hospitals currently collect to support improvements in internal customer services and quality related activities. The HCAHPS survey contains 21 patient perspectives on care and patient rating items that encompass nine key topics- communication with doctors, communication with nurses, responsiveness of hospital staff, pain management, communication about medicines, discharge information, cleanliness of the hospital environment, quietness of the hospital environment, and transition of care. The survey also includes four screener questions and seven demographic items, which are used for adjusting the mix of patients across hospitals and for analytical purposes. The survey is 32 questions in length. HCAHPS On-Line, the official HCAHPS Web site, houses a series of tables that summarize current and historic HCAHPS results.

The QRS, QIS, and ESS will inform consumer selection of a qualified health plan (QHP), decisions about QHP certification, and the Federal and State Marketplaces monitoring of QHP performance. The QRS is a system that rates QHPs based on relative quality and price. Documents describing the QRS data collection guidelines, technical specifications, and the QRS measures are available on this page. CMS is developing two consumer experience surveys to assess consumers and enrollees experiences with the Marketplaces and QHPs. The Health Insurance Marketplace Survey (Marketplace Survey) is intended to obtain consumers perspectives on the services provided by Marketplaces. Conducted during the 2014 open enrollment period, the purpose of the usability testing was to determine whether the State-Based Marketplace Web sites adopted principles for making a Web site usable for consumers and whether information about determining eligibility, comparing and choosing a health plan, and enrollment was easy to find. Results from this assessment are available on this page. The Qualified Health Plan Enrollee Experience Survey (QHP Enrollee Survey) is intended to obtain enrollees perspectives on the services provided by QHPs offered through the Marketplaces. Copies of the current survey in English, Spanish, and Chinese, are available on this page. QHP Enrollee Survey reports will be available in 2015.

Since 1999, CMS has required Medicare-certified home health agencies to collect and transmit OASIS data for all adult patients whose care is reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid with the exception of patients receiving pre- or postnatal services only. OASIS data are used for multiple purposes including calculating several types of quality reports that are provided to home health agencies to help guide quality and performance improvement efforts. OASIS-C includes data items supporting measurement of rates for use of specific evidence-based care processes. The OASIS-C1 - ICD-9 version went into effect at 1200 a.m. on January 1, 2015 and shall remain in effect until ICD-10 is implemented or until another disposition is made by CMS. The following two categories of quality measures are used in the Home Health Quality Reporting Program (HH QRP) 1.Outcome measures and 2.Process measures. This site contains brief descriptions of each measure type and how the data for that measure is calculated, it provides links to technical documentation, tables identifying which Home Health Quality Measures are risk-adjusted and reported publicly, and additional resources. Lists of all home health quality measures and designation of which are publicly reported can be found on the Quality Measures page accessed from the list on the left of this page.","HasHealthData":1,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/Medicare\/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments\/HomeHealthQualityInits\/index.html","AgencyProgramURL":"","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"james.krometis@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"James Krometis","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"2006-2014","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"","DatasetGroupName":"","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"cms.data@cms.hhs.gov","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"Medicare","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"585","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publicly Available Data File - for download"},{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Reports"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicaid"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicare"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Acute Care Hospital"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Home Health (HHA)"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Part A"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Emergency Room-Department"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Quality"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Readmissions"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Claims"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Utilization"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Outcomes"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1460061042000+0000)\/","Name":"Home Health Quality Initiative","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"http:\/\/www.medicare.gov\/hospitalcompare\/","Description":"Hospital Compare has information about the quality of care at over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals across the country.

This study used a Pew Charitable Trust survey of a nationally representative, random sample of 3,014 adult U.S. residents to examine their use of the Internet and mHealth (mobile health) technologies across insurance types. The report finds that most self-reported Internet users seek health information and privately insured respondents (compared with other insurance types) are more likely to use new technologies. Medicaid beneficiaries are more likely than the privately insured to share health information online and Medicare beneficiaries are more likely than the privately insured to text with health professionals.

This burden is especially higher in rural areas, which are known to report higher cancer frequency and death rate. Population based cancer research, aimed at identifying variations in cancer care and improving cancer outcomes in the rural and medically underserved elderly population, is much needed. Unfortunately, such research has been challenging due to limitations in available data sources. The research article, entitled Linking Medicare, Medicaid, and Cancer Registry Data to Study the Burden of Cancers in West Virginia, published in Volume 2, Number 4 of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, describes the creation of a comprehensive dataset by combining the West Virginia Cancer Registry with Medicare, Medicaid, and other data sources.

The jurisdictions listed  are based on the MAC jurisdictions assigned during the 2014 and 2015 Medicare FFS improper payment report periods i.e., July 1, 2012 - June 30, 2013, and July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2014, respectively.  An Error Rate Contribution Score was assigned to each jurisdiction to reflect two key variables, the jurisdictions improper payment rate and share of national improper payments.","HasHealthData":1,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"https:\/\/www.cms.gov\/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems\/Monitoring-Programs\/Medicare-FFS-Compliance-Programs\/CERT\/MedicareFFSJurisdictionErrorRateContributionData.html","AgencyProgramURL":"https:\/\/www.cms.gov\/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems\/Monitoring-Programs\/Medicare-FFS-Compliance-Programs\/CERT\/index.html","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"Annually","ContactEmail":"Chrissy.Fowler@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"Chrissy Fowler","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"2014-2015","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"","DatasetGroupName":"","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"CERT@cms.hhs.gov","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"Medicare","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"651","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publications"},{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Statistics"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicare"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Durable Medical Equipment (DME)"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Physician Services"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Acute Care Hospital"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Ambulatory"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Ambulatory Surgical Center"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Community Health Center"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Community Treatment"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Dialysis Center"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Home Health (HHA)"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Hospice"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Hospital"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Inpatient"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Medical Imaging"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Outpatient"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Part A"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Part B"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Pharmacy"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Providers"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Skilled Nursing (SNF)"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Substance Abuse Treatment"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Suppliers"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Vendors"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Nursing Home"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Psychiatric Facility"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Long Term Care (LTC)"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Psychiatric Treatment Center"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Short Stay Hospital (SSH)"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"National"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC)"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Payment Error Rate"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1470757632000+0000)\/","Name":"Medicare FFS Jurisdiction Error Rate Contribution Data","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/Medicare\/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment\/PhysicianFeedbackProgram\/index.html","Description":"The Physician Feedback - Value-Based Modifier Program provides comparative performance information to physicians as one part of Medicares efforts to improve the quality and efficiency of medical care.

Section 3003 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 requires that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) develop an episode grouper. CMS is applying episode grouping algorithms specially designed for constructing episodes of care in the Medicare population. The Supplemental Quality and Resource Use Reports QRURs are confidential feedback reports provided to medical group practices with payment-standardized, risk-adjusted cost information on the management of their Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients based on episodes of care.

Even though there is a lack of standard definition and identification of a chronic condition, these conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes, are long-lasting and persistent health problems that require continuous care. Recent research has emphasized the disproportionate share of beneficiaries with chronic conditions in healthcare expenditures (Anderson, 2010). For example, patients with multiple chronic conditions can cost up to seven times as much as patients with only one chronic condition. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic diseases are responsible for more than 75 percent of the 2.5 trillion spent annually on health care. Examples of efforts to estimate the spending or costs by individual conditions are shown in Exhibit 1.","HasHealthData":0,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"cynthia.riegler@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"Cindy Riegler","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"http:\/\/www.resdac.org\/cms-data\/request\/cms-data-request-center","DatasetGroupName":"","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"MMRR-Editors@cms.hhs.gov","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"448","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publications"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Dual Eligibles"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicare"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Hospital"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Part A"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Part B"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"National"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Screenings"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Readmissions"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Eligibility"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Payments"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Rates"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Preventive Services"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Chronic Condition"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1371716963000+0000)\/","Name":"Medicare Payments, How Much Do Chronic Conditions Matter","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"https:\/\/data.cms.gov\/use-agreement?id=sk9b-znav","Description":"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has prepared a public data set, the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data -

The results indicate service use is more intensive during the initial days of the episode and for the last few days prior to death, relative to the middle days of care, except for relatively short episodes where use is quite intensive throughout the stay. Using enhanced data on the intensity of service use, the results confirm previous research that suggested a similar pattern to service use during a hospice episode.

Medical specialists and primary care providers were most likely to submit a PQRS report, most frequently e-prescribing, electronic health records, and process quality measures. Reporting providers were involved with 17 percent of the beneficiarys NH-EM visits in 2009 compared to fifty percent for the provider of the plurality of NH-EM visits.

In contrast to this work, most of the prior research on geographic variation in health spending focused on health spending for Medicare enrollees, at a sub-state or individual level. This paper shows that state-level income, health care capacity, and the share of elderly residents are the most important factors in explaining variation in personal health care spending per capita among states over time. Because the slow-moving nature of health spending per capita and close relationships among state-level factors create inefficiencies in modeling this variation, multiple modeling strategies were utilized to obtain more robust interpretations of the overall results.\u000d\u000a","HasHealthData":0,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"Cynthia.riegler@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"Cindy Riegler","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"http:\/\/www.resdac.org\/cms-data\/request\/cms-data-request-center","DatasetGroupName":"","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"mmrr-editors@cms.hhs.gov","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"486","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publications"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicaid"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicare"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Health Insurance Marketplace"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Physician Services"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Prescription Drug Plans"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"State"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Expenditures"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1386076363000+0000)\/","Name":"Modeling Per Capita State Health Expenditure Variat...","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr\/Articles\/A2014\/MMRR2014_004_04_a04.html","Description":"Findings from a study entitled, Monitoring and Reporting Hospital-Acquired Conditions -  A Federalist Approach, published in Volume 4, Issue 4 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, shows that 28 states have serious adverse event reporting systems authorized and operated by state governments.

State selections of adverse events to report were at least partially influenced by Medicares list of hospital acquired conditions (HACs) for nonpayment. Federal initiatives have bolstered HAC reporting activity at the state level, yet there is still wide variability and lack of standardization.

Compared to usual obstetrical care, care by midwives at a birth center could reduce costs to the Medicaid program, according to Potential Medicaid Cost Savings from Maternity Care Based at a Freestanding Birth Center, published in Volume 4, Issue 3 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review. This study draws on information from a previous study of the maternal and infant outcomes of birth center care to determine whether such care reduces Medicaid costs for low income women. Costs to Medicaid are derived from birth center data and from other national sources of the cost of obstetrical care. The authors estimate that birth center care could save an average of 1,164 dollars per birth (2008 constant dollars), or 11.6 million dollars per 10,000 births per year. As Medicaid faces continuing cost increases and budget constraints, policy makers may want to consider a larger role for midwives and birth centers in maternity care for low-risk Medicaid pregnant women.","HasHealthData":0,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr\/","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"cynthia.porter@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"Cynthia Porter","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"","DatasetGroupName":"","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"mmrr-editors@cms.hhs.gov","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"Medicaid","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"531","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publications"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicaid"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Hospital"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Providers"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"State"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Expenditures"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Outcomes"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1410420876000+0000)\/","Name":"Potential Medicaid Cost Savings from Maternity Care Based..","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/CCIIO\/Programs-and-Initiatives\/Health-Insurance-Market-Reforms\/rebate-estimates.html","Description":"These estimates are provided from 2010 data.

A 10-percent increase in reporting, the equivalent to reporting one more indicator per agency, increased the probability of a home health agency leaving an area with less-educated people by 0.3 percentage points, compared with leaving an area with high education. This small level of market-area exits under public reporting is unlikely to be practically meaningful, suggesting that Home Health Compare did not lead to a disruption in access to home health care through selective exits during the initial year of the program.

Known as the Measures Management System (MMS), this system is composed of a set of business processes and decision criteria that CMS funded measure developers follow in the development, implementation, and maintenance of quality measures. The steps in the measure development process are summarized in the document Quality Measures Development Overview. CMS funded a project to review assessment approaches that could be used across post-acute settings to reduce care fragmentation and unsafe transitions, and to compare outcomes and costs for patients discharged to post acute care. The report entitled Uniform Patient Assessment for Post Acute Care (PAC) Final Report and a stand alone executive summary are available. The overall goal of the Development of Quality Indicators for Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRFs) project was to assist CMS in developing appropriate measures to monitor and evaluate the quality of rehabilitation services provided to Medicare beneficiaries in IRFs. The key questions addressed by this report include - What are the expected outcomes of an inpatient rehabilitation stay, What factors affect those outcomes, Do we have appropriate measures of those relationships, And if not, what measures do we need, Funded by CMS, in considering these key questions, Research Triangle Institute (RTI) incorporated expertise from the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation services to develop measures specific to the rehabilitation field that would target these issues while still minimizing the administrative reporting burdens for providers.

The study focuses on the personal health care (PHC) sector, which includes the goods and services rendered to treat or prevent a specific disease or condition in an individual. The official 2007 NHEA estimate for PHC spending is 1,915 billion dollars and the MEPS estimate is 1,126 billion dollars. Adjusting the NHEA estimates for differences in underlying populations, covered services, and other measurement concepts reduces the NHEA estimate for 2007 to 1,366 billion dollars. As a result, MEPS is 240 billion dollars, or 17.6 percent less than the adjusted NHEA total. The reconciliation provides a consistent baseline of health expenditure data for policy simulations, enabling researchers to adjust MEPS to be consistent with the NHEA so that the projected costs, as well as budgetary and tax implications of any policy change are consistent with national health spending estimates.","HasHealthData":0,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"","AgencySubAgency":"CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"MMRR-Editors@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"Cindy Riegler","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"","DatasetGroupName":"","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"407","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publications"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Home Health (HHA)"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Hospital"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Pharmacy"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Nursing Home"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"National"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Expenditures"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Payment Sources"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Survey"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1384857225000+0000)\/","Name":"Reconciling Medical Expenditure Estimates from the MEPS...","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems\/Monitoring-Programs\/Medicare-FFS-Compliance-Programs\/Recovery-Audit-Program\/","Description":"The Recovery Audit Programs mission is to identify and correct Medicare improper payments through the efficient detection and collection of overpayments made on claims of health care services provided to Medicare beneficiaries, and the identification of underpayments to providers so that the CMS can implement actions that will prevent future improper payments in all 50 states.","HasHealthData":0,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"","ContactName":"","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"http:\/\/www.resdac.org\/cms-data\/request\/cms-data-request-center","DatasetGroupName":"","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"244","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Reports"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicare"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"National"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"State"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Payment Error Rate"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Claims"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Payments"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1407506453000+0000)\/","Name":"Recovery Audit Program ","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"https:\/\/www.cms.gov\/cciio\/Resources\/forms-reports-and-other-resources\/index.html","Description":"Before the Affordable Care Act, Americans with pre-existing conditions who did not receive health coverage through their employers had few affordable options to get the care they needed.

Medicare payments include both geographic and policy-based facility type differentials (e.g., wage index and disproportionate share hospital), which can bias cost comparisons of hospitals and averages across geographic areas. Standardizing payment information to remove the area- and policy-based payment differentials should normalize much of the observed geographic variability in payments, allowing for a more accurate comparison of resource use between providers and across geographic regions. Use of standardized payments will ensure that observed payment variation is due to differences in practice patterns and service use, rather than Medicare payment differences over which the providers have no control.

The crowding-out of private insurance is often used to criticize state Medicaid and Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) expansion, as already insured children move their coverage to the states at the publics expense. A difficulty in discussing crowd-out comes from inconsistent estimates. Previous work focusing on the expansion of public programs has led to estimates ranging from 0 to 50 percent of the children newly insured on public plans being crowded-out.","HasHealthData":0,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr\/index.html","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"N\/A","ContactEmail":"cynthia.riegler@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"Cindy Riegler","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"http:\/\/www.resdac.org\/cms-data\/request\/cms-data-request-center","DatasetGroupName":"","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"mmrr-editors@cms.hhs.gov","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"Children's Health","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"451","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publications"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"CHIP"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicaid"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Physician Services"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"National"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"State"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Eligibility"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Enrollment"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Survey"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1373553743000+0000)\/","Name":"State Variability in Childrens Medicaid Crowd-Out Estimates","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr\/Articles\/A2012\/mmrr-2012-002-04-a04.html","Description":"According to analysis reported in Statistical Uncertainty in the Medicare Shared Savings Program published in Volume 2, Issue 4 of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, the role of random fluctuations in year-to-year healthcare spending may play a larger role in savings measurement than previously anticipated.

The article, Affordable Care Act Risk Adjustment - Overview, Context, and Challenges, describes the key program goal and issues in the HHS developed risk adjustment methodology and identifies key choices in how it responds to these issues, while The HHS-HCC Risk Adjustment Model for Individual and Small Group Markets under the Affordable Care Act, estimates differences in health risks taking into account the new population and scope of coverage. Risk Transfer Formula for Individual and Small Group Markets under the Affordable Care Act, describes how the transfer formula calculates balanced transfers intended to account for health risk differences while preserving permissible premium differences.","HasHealthData":0,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"cynthia.porter@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"Cynthia Porter","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"","DatasetGroupName":"","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"mmrr-editors@cms.hhs.gov","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"Medicare","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"528","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publications"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicaid-Expansion"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicare Advantage"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Health Insurance Marketplace"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Physician Services"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Hospital"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Inpatient"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Outpatient"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Part D"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"National"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Quality"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Claims"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Covered Services"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Eligibility"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Enrollment"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Expenditures"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Payments"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1410251618000+0000)\/","Name":"The HHS-HCC Risk Adjustment Model for Individual and Small","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr\/Articles\/A2013\/MMRR2013-003-02-a03.html","Description":"Our nation is in the midst of an unprecedented investment in IT to support healthcare delivery.

They found that while non-profits are much larger than for-profit agencies and have lower costs per patient, they have higher costs per visit. Both types of agencies show diseconomies of scale, suggesting that efficiencies could be achieved if the industry operated smaller scale agencies, increased the salaried nursing staff while it decreased the number of contract nurses, and emphasized patient assessment services.

In Use of Hospitalists by Medicare Beneficiaries, A National Picture, the authors developed the MD-PPAS database, in which they identified hospitalists as physicians trained in primary care who billed at least 90 percent of their total charges in a year for Medicare in inpatient settings. Their findings, published in Volume 4, Issue 2 of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, show that hospitalists made up 4.4 percent of all physicians serving Medicare beneficiaries in 2011 and 13.3 percent of primary care physicians. Over a quarter of Medicare admissions had a hospitalist as the attending physician, though the rate was much higher for medical than surgical admissions (32 percent versus 11 percent). Between 2009 and 2011, medical admissions with a hospitalist attending increased from 26 percent to 32 percent. The ability to identify hospitalists from claims data will help research on the impact of hospitalist use on quality and cost.","HasHealthData":0,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr","AgencySubAgency":"HHS\/CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"cynthia.porter@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"Cynthia Porter","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"http:\/\/www.resdac.org\/cms-data\/request\/cms-data-request-center","DatasetGroupName":"MMRR","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"mmrr-editors@cms.hhs.gov","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"CMS","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"Medicare","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"513","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publications"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicare"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Hospital"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Inpatient"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Providers"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"National"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Quality"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Admissions"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Claims"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Rates"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1402999095000+0000)\/","Name":"Use of Hospitalists by Medicare Benes, A National Picture","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false},{"Address":"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/mmrr\/Briefs\/B2013\/MMRR2013_003_03_b03.html","Description":"The establishment in recent years of a National Provider Identifier (NPI) offers a new method for counting and categorizing physicians and other health care professionals involved in clinical care.

In February 2008, Wisconsin expanded and reformed its Medicaid CHIP program and, as part of program implementation, automatically enrolled a set of newly eligible parents and children. This process of auto enrollment targeted newly eligible parents and older children whose children siblings were already enrolled in the states Medicaid CHIP program. Auto enrollment brought over 44,000 individuals into the program, representing more than 60 percent of all enrollees in the first month of the reformed program. Individuals who were auto enrolled were modestly more likely to leave the program relative to other individuals who enrolled in February 2008, unless their incomes were high enough to be required to pay premiums. These auto enrollees were much more likely to exit relative to other enrollees subject to premium payments. The higher exit rates exhibited by non premium paying auto enrollees were likely due to the fact that over 40 percent of auto enrollees were covered by a private insurance policy in the month of their enrollment, compared to approximately 30 percent for regular enrollees. A national simulation of an auto enrollment process similar to Wisconsins, including the expansion of adult Medicaid eligibility to 133 percent of the federal poverty level under the ACA, suggests that 2.5 million of the 5.6 million newly eligible parents could be auto enrolled, and approximately 25 percent of this population would be privately insured. These results suggest that auto enrollment may be appropriate for other states, especially in their efforts to enroll eligible populations who are not subject to premium requirements.","HasHealthData":0,"HealthData":{"AccessPointURL":"","AgencyProgramURL":"","AgencySubAgency":"CMS","CollectionFrequency":"","ContactEmail":"MMRR-Editors@cms.hhs.gov","ContactName":"Cindy Riegler","ContactPhoneNumber":"","CoveragePeriod":"","CoveragePeriodFiscalYear":"","DataCollectionInstrumentURL":"","DataDictionaryURL":"","DataLicenseAgreementURL":"","DatasetGroupName":"","DateReleased":null,"DateUpdated":null,"GenericContactEmail":"","GenericContactName":"","GeographicScope":"","HHSGroup":"","MediaFormat":"","SubjectArea":"","TechnicalDocumentationURL":"","UnitOfAnalysis":""},"ID":"398","Keywords":[{"CategoryName":"Document Type","Description":null,"Name":"Publications"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"CHIP"},{"CategoryName":"Program","Description":null,"Name":"Medicaid"},{"CategoryName":"Setting\/Type of Care","Description":null,"Name":"Part B"},{"CategoryName":"Geography","Description":null,"Name":"State"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Eligibility"},{"CategoryName":"Topic","Description":null,"Name":"Enrollment"}],"LastModified":"\/Date(1384857441000+0000)\/","Name":"Wisconsins Experience with Medicaid Auto Enrollment","Popularity":0,"RequiresCustomAccessForms":false}]
